.. ; -*- rst -*- (This file is to be included in the toplevel directory of a release tarball)

What is in this directory
=========================

This directory is a release of XCVB.

The ``xcvb/`` subdirectory contains xcvb itself.

The ``dependencies/`` subdirectory contains
several other Common Lisp packages that XCVB depends on.

The ``Makefile`` will help you install.


Additional Dependencies
=======================

In addition to the Common Lisp source code included in this release tarball,
you will need the following software installed on your computer
to successfully compile and use XCVB.

First, you will need one of the supported CL implementations.
Currently supported are:

	* sbcl http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/
        * clisp http://clisp.cons.org/
        * ccl http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl

Second, to use the "master" mode of XCVB that allows compilation inside a
running image, you will also need the ``tthsum`` utility.
Otherwise, you will have to disable support for this mode
by passing option ``--no-master`` to ``xcvb make-makefile``.
If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, you may get ``tthsum`` with::

	sudo apt-get install tthsum


How to install XCVB
===================

To install XCVB compiled with the default Lisp under ``/usr/local``, just::

	make install

To install XCVB compiled with ``sbcl`` under ``/opt``, instead try::

	make install PREFIX=/opt LISP=sbcl

To install XCVB using ASDF and compiling with clisp, for bootstrap purposes, instead try::

        make install-using-asdf PREFIX=/opt LISP=clisp

Note that using ASDF requires installing all the source. You can also install the source with::

        make install-source PREFIX=/opt

Look inside the ``Makefile`` to see the supported parameters.
For fine-tuning beyond those parameters, you may have to manually
edit ``xcvb/configure.mk``.


What Next?
==========

To use XCVB, look at the documentation in ``xcvb/doc/README.rest``
If you have the python-docutils installed, you can compile it to html with::

	make -C xcvb doc/README.html

Assuming you are in the directory where you extracted the release tarball,
you can check that XCVB is working with::

	X=$PWD ; export CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY=${X}// ; cd $X/xcvb ; make xcvb

To hack XCVB, get familiar with it, look at the documentation in
``INTERNALS.rest`` and ``TODO.rest``. A good starting project would be to build
a test suite for XCVB itself.
