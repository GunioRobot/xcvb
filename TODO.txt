-Dump partial images for [combinations of] asdf systems required
-Sort partial images alphabetically, then require them one by one
-May need to load xcvb-runtime.lisp first thing in target lisp and/or dump and image with it
-Manage auto dumping
	a) Systematically or randomly or based on a probabilistic cost/benefit analysis dump images for intermediate states
	b) Be able to detect that an intermediate state is usable and resume from it
-Find a way to detect if an asdf system needs recompiling
-Play well with asdf-system-connections (low priority)
-Run asdf-dependency-grovel on just quux
-Look at make-qres-dependencies and see how it is called from the Makefile.
