-Dump partial images for [combinations of] asdf systems required
-Sort partial images alphabetically, then require them one by one
-May need to load xcvb-runtime.lisp first thing in target lisp and/or dump and image with it
-Manage auto dumping
	a) Systematically or randomly or based on a probabilistic cost/benefit analysis dump images for intermediate states
	b) Be able to detect that an intermediate state is usable and resume from it
-Find a way to detect if an asdf system needs recompiling - DONE
-Play well with asdf-system-connections (low priority)
-Run asdf-dependency-grovel on just quux - DONE
-Look at make-qres-dependencies and see how it is called from the Makefile - DONE

-Make the asdf dependencies from BUILD.lisp carry through to everything under it.  Do that by having the first thing you do be to dump an image with BUILD's asdf system's loaded, and use that as the image from then on.  Do this as follows:

.PHONY: core-with-asd-systems-loaded

core-with-asd-systems-loaded:
   if ! ( [ -f ${CWASL} ] && ${CWASL} --eval '(xcvb:core-with-asdf-systems-loaded-is-up-to-date-p)' )
     ...(re)compile the core from scratch...
   fi

(defun core-with-asdf-systems-loaded-is-up-to-date-p ()
   ...
   (sb-ext:exit 0)
   (sb-ext:exit 1))
